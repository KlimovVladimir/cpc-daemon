# Libcpc

This library exports all underlying functions, enums and constants to easily interoperate with the C API of CPC by proving safe Rust wrappers. The dependencies needed to build the library are:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [CPCd](../../../readme.md)
- [libclang-dev](https://index.ros.org/d/libclang-dev/)

See the [sample app](./sample_app) on how to get a basic project started.

## Build

`cargo build`
